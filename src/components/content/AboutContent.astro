  <h1>About SLNG</h1>
  <p>
    SLNG is an iOS app that helps you understand and translate slang into
    standard Indonesian and English. It highlights informal expressions and
    suggests clear alternatives, so your messages stay natural while being easy
    to understand.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h1>
  <p>To make communication clearer and more enjoyable.</p>

  <h2>Language is more than words</h2>
  <p>
    In Indonesia, language changes fast — new slang, abbreviations, and online
    expressions appear every day. SLNG helps you keep up with these trends by
    translating and explaining slang in real time, directly from your keyboard.
    Whether you're chatting with friends, scrolling through social media, or
    learning Indonesian culture, SLNG makes sure you understand not just what
    people say, but what they mean.
  </p>

  <h2>Born from Indonesia’s living language</h2>
  <p>
    Indonesia is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.
    With hundreds of local languages and countless internet slang variations,
    communication here is full of creativity and personality. SLNG was created
    to capture that energy — helping people from all backgrounds understand and
    enjoy how Indonesians actually speak, both online and offline.
  </p>

  <h2>Built for real conversations</h2>
  <p>
    SLNG integrates directly into your keyboard, making it easy to look up
    meanings or translations without leaving your chat. It’s fast, intuitive,
    and designed to feel natural in your daily conversations.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Values</h2>
  <p>
    We believe that language is culture. SLNG celebrates how Indonesians express
    identity, humor, and connection through words. We’re committed to building
    technology that respects privacy, embraces diversity, and keeps human
    creativity at the center.
  </p>

  <h2>Privacy and Trust First</h2>
  <p>
    Your conversations belong to you. SLNG never sells, shares, or rents user
    data. We design our technology with transparency and privacy as core
    principles. For details, see our
    <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Made in Indonesia, for the World</h2>
  <p>
    SLNG is proudly developed by a small team of Indonesian creators passionate
    about language, culture, and technology. Our mission is to help people
    everywhere understand the heart of Indonesian expressions — and maybe share
    a few of their own.
  </p>

    abbreviation, or trend ever leaves you behind. Start typing and discover how
