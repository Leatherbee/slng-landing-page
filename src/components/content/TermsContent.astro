  <h1>SLNG Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 17, 2025</p>

  <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>By downloading, accessing, or using SLNG, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

  <h2>Eligibility & Accounts</h2>
  <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service; if under 18, you represent you have parental or guardian consent. You are responsible for your device, account, and credentials, and for all activity under your account.</p>

  <h2>Privacy</h2>
  <p>Use of SLNG is subject to the SLNG Privacy Policy available in-app. We process limited personal data to operate features (e.g., slang detection and translation). Data may be processed in the countries where we and our providers operate. You may submit access, deletion, or objection requests via in‑app support.</p>

  <h2>License & App Store EULA</h2>
  <p>We grant you a limited, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to use SLNG in accordance with these Terms. When obtained through the Apple App Store, your license is also subject to Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement (<a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/">Apple EULA</a>). In case of conflict, the Apple EULA governs for App Store distribution. Reverse engineering, bulk content copying, or unlawful use is prohibited.</p>

  <h2>Paid Services</h2>
  <p>
    If available, subscriptions or in-app purchases are subject to platform payment
    terms and applicable refund policies.
  </p>

  <h2>User Conduct & Prohibited Use</h2>
  <p>You will not use the Service to violate law, infringe intellectual property, harass or harm others, upload malware or spam, misrepresent identity, scrape or probe systems, or for safety‑critical or professional advice purposes.</p>

  <h2>User Content</h2>
  <p>You remain the owner of content submitted to SLNG. You grant us a limited license to process content to provide features. You represent you have necessary rights and consents. We may remove content that breaches these Terms or law.</p>

  <h2>AI/Translation Accuracy</h2>
  <p>Outputs may be incomplete or inaccurate and are provided for informational purposes only. Do not rely on SLNG for medical, legal, financial, or emergency decisions.</p>

  <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>SLNG may link to or integrate third‑party services. We do not control and are not responsible for third‑party content or policies. Your use of third‑party services is at your own risk.</p>


  <h2>Support & Maintenance</h2>
  <p>We provide app support as described in‑app. Apple has no obligation to provide maintenance or support for SLNG.</p>

  <h2>Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access for violations, risk, abuse, or legal reasons. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon termination, your license ends and provisions intended to survive (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitations) continue.</p>

  <h2>Indemnification</h2>
  <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the SLNG developers from claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising from your use of the Service or breach of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>The Service is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. To the extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages. Our total liability for all claims is limited to the greater of US$50 or the amounts you paid for SLNG in the 12 months preceding the claim. Nothing in these Terms excludes liability where prohibited by law.</p>

  <h2>Export & Sanctions Compliance</h2>
  <p>You confirm you are not located in a country subject to embargo or on a prohibited list and will comply with applicable export and sanctions laws.</p>

  <h2>Governing Law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the law applicable in the SLNG developer’s jurisdiction, without regard to conflict of laws. Courts in that jurisdiction have non‑exclusive jurisdiction. Consumers may have mandatory rights under local law.</p>

  <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Material changes will be notified in‑app or on the site. The latest version is effective as of the date above.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions or rights requests, contact the support listed in the app.</p>
