  <h1>SLNG Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> November 17, 2025</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how SLNG collects, uses, stores, and protects
    your personal information when using our app and services. We are committed
    to minimal and transparent data processing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use of SLNG is also subject to the Terms of Use available in‑app.
  </p>
  <h2>Controller</h2>
  <p>
    The data controller is the SLNG developers. Contact details are available in‑app via support.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app interactions, performance, and diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device data:</strong> device model, OS version, and non-persistent identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Input content:</strong> text you type for detection/translation is processed
      temporarily to produce output and, by default, is not stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Account data (optional):</strong> if you sign up for features that require identification, we may
      store the email or user ID required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve SLNG services.</li>
    <li>Detect technical issues and maintain security.</li>
    <li>Service communications (e.g., updates, support).</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Analytics & Measurement</h2>
  <p>
    We use analytics to understand feature usage and improve reliability. This may include event logs and aggregated metrics. Where implemented, we use Apple and Google measurement services (e.g., Firebase Analytics, GoogleAppMeasurement). We do not use analytics data for third‑party advertising.
  </p>
  <h2>AI Processing & Model Training</h2>
  <p>
    Input content is processed to generate translations and detections. By default, we do not use your content to train our models. Third‑party AI providers, if engaged, process data under their policies; we minimize what is sent and avoid persistent storage.
  </p>
  <h2>Tracking & Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    We do not conduct cross‑app tracking or targeted advertising. If in the future tracking is introduced, we will request your permission via App Tracking Transparency (ATT) and update this Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Data may be shared with trusted service
    providers (e.g., analytics and crash reporting) only as necessary and with
    adequate safeguards.
  </p>
  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Data may be processed in the countries where we and our providers operate. Where required, safeguards such as standard contractual clauses are applied.
  </p>

  <h2>Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes described. By
    default, input content is processed transiently. If you create saved lists
    (e.g., favorites/private dictionary), that data remains until you delete it
    or close your account.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect
    data, including encryption in transit and access minimization practices.
  </p>
  <h2>Keyboard Extension & Open Access</h2>
  <p>
    When enabling the SLNG keyboard with “Allow Full Access,” typed input may be transmitted to our service to provide detection/translation features. We do not intentionally process input entered into secure fields (e.g., password or payment forms). You can revoke full access at any time in iOS Settings.
  </p>
  <h2>Microphone & Speech Recognition</h2>
  <p>
    If you enable voice features, audio is processed to transcribe speech into text. Audio is processed transiently and not stored by default. You can disable microphone permissions in system settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correction, or deletion of data.</li>
    <li>Object to or withdraw certain consent.</li>
    <li>Contact us for privacy questions or complaints.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Legal Bases (EEA)</h2>
  <p>
    Where the GDPR applies, we process data based on legitimate interests (service operation and improvement) and consent where required (e.g., optional features). You may object to processing where applicable.
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The service is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable minimum
    age in your region). We do not knowingly collect children’s data; if we
    become aware, we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will
    be announced in the app or on the site. The latest version is effective as
    of the date listed above.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>

    the app.
