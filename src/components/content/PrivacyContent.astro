  <h1>SLNG Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 27, 2025</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how SLNG collects, uses, stores, and protects
    your personal information when using our app and services. We are committed
    to minimal and transparent data processing.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> app interactions, performance, and diagnostics.</li>
    <li><strong>Device data:</strong> device model, OS version, and non-persistent identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Input content:</strong> text you type for detection/translation is processed
      temporarily to produce output and, by default, is not stored.</li>
    <li><strong>Account data (optional):</strong> if you sign up or subscribe to features, we may
      store the email or user ID required.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve SLNG services.</li>
    <li>Detect technical issues and maintain security.</li>
    <li>Service communications (e.g., updates, support).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell your personal data. Data may be shared with trusted service
    providers (e.g., analytics and crash reporting) only as necessary and with
    adequate safeguards.
  </p>

  <h2>Storage & Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Data is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes described. By
    default, input content is processed transiently. If you create saved lists
    (e.g., favorites/private dictionary), that data remains until you delete it
    or close your account.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect
    data, including encryption in transit and access minimization practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Access, correction, or deletion of data.</li>
    <li>Object to or withdraw certain consent.</li>
    <li>Contact us for privacy questions or complaints.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children</h2>
  <p>
    The service is not directed to children under 13 (or the applicable minimum
    age in your region). We do not knowingly collect children’s data; if we
    become aware, we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will
    be announced in the app or on the site. The latest version is effective as
    of the date listed above.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
  <p>
    For privacy inquiries, please contact us via the support email listed in
    the app.
