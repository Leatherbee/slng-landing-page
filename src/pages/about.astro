      <h2>Language is more than words</h2>
      <p>
        In Indonesia, language changes fast, new slang, abbreviations, and online expressions
        appear every day. SLNG helps you keep up with these trends by translating and
        explaining slang in real time, directly from your keyboard. Whether you are chatting with
        friends, scrolling through social media, or learning Indonesian culture, SLNG makes sure
        you understand not just what people say, but what they mean.
      </p>

      <h2>Born from Indonesia’s living language</h2>
      <p>
        Indonesia is one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world. With hundreds of
        local languages and countless internet slang variations, communication here is full of
        creativity and personality. SLNG was created to capture that energy, helping people from
        all backgrounds understand and enjoy the way Indonesians actually speak online and
        offline.
      </p>

      <h2>Built for real conversations</h2>
      <p>
        SLNG integrates directly into your keyboard, making it easy to look up meanings or
        translations without leaving your chat. It’s fast, intuitive, and designed to feel natural in
        your daily conversations.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Values</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that language is culture. SLNG is built to celebrate how Indonesians express
        identity, humor, and connection through words. We’re committed to building technology
        that respects privacy, embraces diversity, and keeps human creativity at the center.
      </p>

      <h2>Privacy and trust first</h2>
      <p>
        Your conversations belong to you. SLNG never sells, shares, or rents user data. We
        design our technology with transparency and privacy as core principles.
      </p>

      <h2>Made in Indonesia, for the world</h2>

        about language, culture, and technology. Our mission is to help people everywhere
